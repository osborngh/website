Hey there, I'm Osborn, an undergraduate student in Ghana, West Africa studying law. I've always had a passion for tech and hope to build a career as a dynamic entrepreneur. On my quest to be 1% better everyday, I put up this site partly as an accountability system; to document my progress and make myself feel happy about it. I hope to write, build and inspire some cool stuff along the way.

#### Topics I'm Looking To Blog About

- Interesting books I read
- Self-Help Advice I've tested and found helpful
- Law in General
- Various Computer Science Topics
